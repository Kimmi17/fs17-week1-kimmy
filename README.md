Hi there! I'm Thuy Dang, a self-taught developer with over two years of experience.

My favorite stacks on front-end are React, Next.js, Material UI, and Redux,
On the back-end side, I am familiar with Express, Clerk, Supabase, and Prisma. Connecting to SQL or NoSQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I also can use React Testing Library, and Jest for testing purposes.

Transitioning from the business world to IT was a crucial decisionâ€”one I now consider among the best choices in my life when every day is filled with excitement of tackling intricate challenges and crafting innovative solutions.

Beyond coding, my world is vibrant with hobbies like painting, cooking and meditation contributing to a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
